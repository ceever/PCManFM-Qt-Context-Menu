# LXQt/Lubuntu PCManFM-Qt (and GNOME Nautilus) Context Menu

**Various context menus (i.e. right click menus aka** *custom actions* **) for LXQt's file manager ... also should work with Nautilus under GNOME.**

**Create your own (!) actions to speed up repetitive tasks or terminal commands, or simply extend your file manager with what you really need.**

Great Linux distribution: https://lxqt.org/ or https://lubuntu.me/ (which use PCManFM-Qt as file manager)

**UPDATES:**

26.02.2023: Upgraded picture datetime rename scripts to Python 3

18.02.2023: Added "Copy name" (to clipboard) action to copy bare names, names with extension, folder paths, full paths and more for single or multiple files.

23.01.2023: Added a 'zenity' progress window to all PDF and image scripts, changed compact.log to append mode and added a fail catch to compact_jpeg in case 'convert' fail due to size limitations (it won't process panoramas beyond 25 MB or so)

11.01.2023: Enhanced "rename_datetime.sh" with a progress window and changed rename.log to append mode

30.12.2022: Added "Extract here" action

---
**INSTALLATION:**

Put the relevant *.desktop* files (<a href="actions/">actions folder</a> above) onto your system (create folder if missing):
* All users: /usr/share/file-manager/actions/
* Current user: ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/

Put the associated scripts (<a href="scripts/">scripts folder</a> above) onto your system:
* All users: /usr/share/file-manager/scripts/
* Current user: ~/.local/share/file-manager/scripts/

**Note**, you might have to render the scripts executable with "chmod +x SCRIPT" before they work. You can actually place them where you want, you just need to make sure to modify the "EXEC=" in the associated *.desktop* file accordingly.

Restart PCManFM-Qt: killall -9 pcmanfm-qt

---
**EXPLANATION & USAGE:**

**.desktop files:**
* *.desktop* files are text files under Linux that generally specify a certain program executable. But they are also used for autostart topics (/etc/xdg/autostart) or for file manager actions, often with Nautilus (GNOME) but also with PCManFM-Qt (LXQt).
* You may adjust the "ICON=" property according to which is available in your system. You can actually also place an icon into /usr/share/file-manager/(icons/) and reference it.
* If you want to place the below scripts anywhere else, you have to modify the path in the relevant *.desktop* file.
* Submenus are created automatically if a *.desktop* file is created with some other *.desktop* file's (actual) file name in the menu's action list. If you delete the menu *.desktop* file, all underlying actions are moved to the main context menu.

**Scripts:**
* The scripts are very simple and you can modify them if required. You might even replace programs that are not on your system by your preferred alternative.
* The scripts are needed due to the limitation of *.desktop* files wrt. the "EXEC=" parameter, which do not accept complex commands.
* **Note**, if you place the scripts under *~/.local/share/file-manager/* you will have to modify the path in the *.desktop* file to your profile path accordingly.

**Dependencies:**

For the specific scripts/context menu to work, they require the following apps/programs:

* PDF: ps2pdf => **ghostscript**, **zenity**
* PDF: gs => **ghostscript**, **zenity**
* PDF: rotate => **pdftk**, **zenity**
* PDF: count => **zenity**, **poppler-utils**
* Mount disk => **udisksctl**
* Bulk rename => **python3**
* JPEG (rename) => **python3**, **libimage-exiftool-perl**, **zenity**
* JPEG (compact) => **imagemagick**, **zenity**
* Send to: Bluetooth => **blueman**
* Send to: Email => **thunderbird**, **perl**
* Send to: 7z archive => **p7zip-full**
* Extract here => **p7zip-full**, **zenity**
* Copy name => **xclip**, **libnotify-bin**

If not yet installed on your system, install via:
<pre>sudo apt install ghostscript pdftk zenity poppler-utils udisksctl python3 libimage-exiftool-perl imagemagick blueman thunderbird perl p7zip-full xclip libnotify-bin</pre>

**THE ACTIONS:**

**Compact PDF actions:**
* These are various ways to make a PDF smaller, with *ps2pdf* being the simplest one.
* *ps2pdf* seems not to change the dpi of pictures, but simply compresses the contained pictures.
* Instead, *gs/print* produces 300 dpi, *gs/ebook* 150 dpi and *gs/ebook/!* 120 dpi.
* Just try them and take the resulting PDF that best fits your (quality) needs.
* You can even modify the *print* and *ebook* parameter of gs/ghostscript in the script to have different options or names.

**"PDF ..."/menu_pdf.desktop:**
* This is the *.desktop* file that creates the submenu for PDF treatment and collects all PDF actions.
* All PDF actions create new files with an according (extended) extension: .sml, .left, .right

**"Queue in VLC":**
* We require two *.desktop* files because it is not possible to filter the selection of files and folders such that the context menu is properly displayed.
* Specifically the following will only always allow a selection of either folders or files, never both at the same time:
<pre>MimeTypes=inode/directory;audio/*;video/*;</pre>

**"Bulk rename":**
* The original can be found here: https://github.com/trhura/nautilus-renamer or https://launchpad.net/nautilus-renamer/+download
* I slightly modified it to have an "Overwrite" option included and for the file handling to work, which fails with the original code and *.desktop* files and the passed file list (%U, %F, etc.).

**"Image ..."/menu_image.desktop:**
* The code is probably not perfect (especially relying on python), but it has worked for me now and I was too lazy to adjust it.
* Either script creates *rename.log' and/or *compact.log* while executing. Check the created *tmp* folder to see if it has finished and now new files get created.

*rename_datetime.sh*:
* It creates *tmp* and *missing* subfolders, where it copies the files with new name or with old name if the relevant EXIF tag is missing, respectively.
* It requires the *datetime_string2name+.py* Python script.
* **It supports time delay** for you to adjust mismatched datetime meta data.
* **It also supports video files** if *exiftool* can find relevant meta information - most videos from smartphones include such EXIF (like) tag. If the default EXIF key (*Date/Time Original*) is not found, the script will ask you to provide an alternative from what it found in the relevant file.

*compact_jpeg.sh*:
* It compacts JPEGs to 96% quality, using *convert* of the imagemagick graphic package.
* It creates *tmp* subfolder, where it copies (only) those JPEGs that decreased in size (5% threshold).
* You can adjust the quality setting and keep-threshold in the script.
* After the script has finished, just move the newly created JPEGs one level higher to overwrite the original files - the original file name is kept.

*resize_image.sh*:
* It creates a new image of half the original's resolution and strips the EXIF (and probably other) meta data.
* This is advantageous in case you want to share the file with strangers or data leeches. This should probably be extended by an arbitrary file name option.

**"Send to ..."/menu_send.desktop:**
* "Bluetooth": Resolves symbolic links and collects files from selected directories. To have the advantageous behaviours of mobiles also on desktop machines, I believed this was a good idea. Such "Sent to ..." commands can probably also include WhatsApp, etc. Currently, I could not think of any others.
* "Desktop (shortcut)": Inspired by Windows and probably missed by many people that switch to Linux. It handles files and folders.
* "Email (attachment)": Inspired by https://github.com/stefonarch/custom-actions . Modified so it can handle several files, directories and symbolic link directories - all is attached. The relevant script requires perl. Unfortunately, this was the only way to produce proper url-encoded file-path names. The program urlencode itself does not handle umlauts properly.
* 7z archive": Uses maximal compression, see script. Script not that nice, because we have to cover for file names with spaces and the input input list. 

**Extract here** (extract_here.sh):
* Since LXQt does not support the "Extract here" option for all kinds of types of archives.
* This extracts extracts everything 7z (command line) supports.
* It is quick and dirty, and does not support passwords.
* It also has a 10 sec timeout (to act on a stuck 7z)âin case your archive is too large, this needs to be adjusted.
* In case you are happy with the already existing "Extract here" of your file browser, you can exclude these cases by reducing the mimetypes in the action file.

**Copy name (to clipboard)** (copy_name.sh and copy_name_plus.sh):
* Single file: Copy the bare filename, name and extension, folder path, full path, as well as the 1st word, 2nd word, 3rd word, or last word of the bare filename, to the clipboard. Some consessions are made for hidden files with "." at the beginning.
* Multiple files: Copy the list of bare filenames, name and extensions, or full paths of the selected files to the clipboard. The latter ist particularly useful because the file manager itself adds "file://" to the names when using CTRL-C.

---
**Can I use these actions to modify the context menu on the LXQt Desktop?**
* Yes, this is indeed possible!
* The above "Queue in VLC" will already popup when (installed and) right clicking the desktop. From there modifying the filter "Basenames=" and "MimeTypes=" should lead you to the desired result.

**FileManager-Actions (tool):**
* A convenient tool to create context menu actions, in case you are uncomfortable with all the options to put into the *.desktop* (text) file.
* Install: <pre>sudo apt install filemanager-actions</pre>
