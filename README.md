**INSTALLATION:**

Put the relevant *.desktop* file under (create if missing):
* Linux (all users): /usr/share/file-manager/actions/
* Linux (current user): ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/

Put the required scripts (executed by the associated *.desktop* file) under:
* Linux (all users): /usr/share/file-manager/
* Linux (current user): ~/.local/share/file-manager/

You might have to render the scripts executeable with "chmod +x SCRIPT" before they work. You can actually place them where you wnat, you just need to make sure to modify the "EXEC=" in the associated *.desktop* file accordingly.

Restart PCManFM-Qt: killall -9 pcmanfm-qt

---
**EXPLANATION & USAGE:**
*.desktop* files are text files under Linux that generally specify a certain program executable. But they are also used for autostart topics (/etc/xdg/autostart) or for filemanager actions, often with Nautilus (GNOME) but also with PCManFM-Qt (LXQt).

**Scripts:**
* The scripts are very simply and you can modify them if required. You might even replace programs that are not on your system by your prefered alternative.
* The scripts are needed due to the limitation of .desktop files wrt. the "EXEC=" parameter, which do not accept complex scripts.
* **Note**, if you place the scripts under *~/.local/share/file-manager/* you will have to modify the path in the *.desktop* file to your profile path accordingly.

**Dependencies:**
For the specific scripts/context menu to work, they require the following apps/programs:

* PDF: ps2pdf => **ghostscript**
* PDF: gs => **ghostscript**
* PDF: rotate => **pdftk**
* PDF: count => **zenity**, **poppler-utils**
* Mount disk => **udisksctl**
* Bulk rename => **python3**

If not yet installed on your system, install via:
<pre>sudo apt install ghostscript pdftk zenity poppler-utils udisksctl python3</pre>

**Bulk rename:**
* The original can be found here: https://github.com/trhura/nautilus-renamer or https://launchpad.net/nautilus-renamer/+download
* I modified slightly it to have an overwrite option included.

**FileManager-Actions:**
* A convenient tool to create context menu actions, in case you are uncomfortable with all the options to put into the *.desktop* (text) file.
* Install: <pre>sudo apt install filemanager-actions</pre>
